# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

### The purpose of this analysis is to find out which employees are retiring from Pewlett Hackard in order to make decisions about retirement packages, and to determine how many vacancies will need to be filled. We need to find out how many employees are retiring per job title and identify which employees are eligible for a mentorship program in order to train the new generation of employees.

## Results

### From the "retirement_titles.csv" we can see that many thousands of employees are approaching retirement, but many of them also have held multiple titles at the company so these need to be narrowed down to only the current job titles:

### From "unique_titles.csv" we can see that now we have only a single entry for each employee since we have eliminated past titles they have held:
